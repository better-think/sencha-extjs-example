/**
 * @class Ext.Gadget
 * @extend Ext.Component
 *
 * `Ext.Gadget` is not actually a class but simply an alternate class name for `Ext.Component`.
 * It is used primarily for writing cross-toolkit widgets.
 *
 * In the classic toolkit, `Ext.Gadget` is an alternate class name for `Ext.Widget`. Since
 * most containers do not accept `Ext.Widget` as `items` in the modern toolkit, this alternate
 * name allows gadgets to be used in a cross-toolkit manner.

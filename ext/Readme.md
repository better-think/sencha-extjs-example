# Sencha Ext JS

This is the Sencha Ext JS Framework Package, or just "ext" for short.

## Installation

Install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install --save @sencha/ext
```

## Dependencies

This will need [@sencha/ext-build](https://github.com/sencha/extjs-reactor/tree/2.0.x-dev/packages/ext-build) to work.

This will be included if you generate the application using [@sencha/ext-gen](https://github.com/sencha/extjs-reactor/tree/2.0.x-dev/packages/ext-gen)
